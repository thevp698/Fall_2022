This program is for the Assignment-2 for the course ECSE-526 Artificial Intelligence 
For this assignment we've to make an AI agent which can order number of mangoes in each hour. The flow of customers coming to the shop as well as customer's buying pattern were given by the instuctor. To solve this proble  we used Value iteration and Policy iteration algorithm.

To run this file you simply have to enter
''' python3 .\run.py N M E1 E2 E3 S C P probfuncname iteration_type -m -t --printtimes  in your command line.
'''
You can find two .py files in the folder, first one is logic.py in which I've defined one class for which I have coded values and policy iteration algorithms.

Below is the sample for passing the command line and you'll find your results.
'''
python3 .\run.py  20, 10, 100, 2, 0.5, 5, 1, 0.5, "normal"  in your command line.
