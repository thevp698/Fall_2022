This program is for the Assignment-3 for the course ECSE-526 Artificial Intelligence 

To run this file you simply have to enter
''' python3 .\ms_pacman.py in your command line.
'''

Unfortunately, this program in not able to run on Linux machine due to some error of SDL display but if you run this locally on your computers you'll see a pop-up window in your computes and it'll start automatically to play and in the screen you can see the mspacman running on your computer.

Also, please load your bin file in your local directory so that during the time of running you won't face any issues, I'll also put bin file with my submission folder so that you can find it and save it in your directory.

Please don't change the name of the bin file, I've entered the name as "MS_PACMAN.BIN" if this is not same as your bin file then program won't run.

Little about the program,
I've divided my program into three part, first part is the game map, where I've used different classes and functions to make my own map which my program easily understand, second part is training and generalization and the third part is running the program. I've used some of the references from the internet to find a way to visualize my game.
